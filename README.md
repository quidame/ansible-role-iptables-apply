Description
-----------

This role populates target's iptables ruleset from a template, also flushing
(the default) or keeping existing rules; or modifies current ruleset by adding
or removing service-specific rules.  If the next task fails, meaning that the
target is not reachable anymore, the firewall is restarted with its initial
configuration, so the ansible controller, at least, is not locked out of its
target.

This role comes with the following features:

- rollback in case of failure
- full firewall configuration from scratch
- blind firewall sanitization by inserting a core of sanity rules *before*
  the current ones, that remain unchanged but may as well never be reached
  anymore.
- per-rule firewall management, allowing other roles to add or remove rules
  when installing or uninstalling services respectively.
- easy-to-write rules, with a list of dictionaries with only two mandatory
  parameters.

This role ships a custom ansible module `iptables_state` to manage saving and
restoring firewall state to/from a file.

Requirements
------------

Firewall management service (`iptables` or `netfilter-persistent`) must be
installed apart.

Role Variables
--------------

All variables used by the role are explicitly declared either in *defaults* or
in *vars* directories. Those declared in *vars* shouldn't be overridden in
almost all cases (and can't be overridden from inventory). So this section
is divided in two parts,
[Common Variables](#common-variables) and
[Advanced Variables](#advanced-variables)

Only a few variables control the behaviour of this role.
See [Template Variables](#template-variables) for variables applying to the
template provided by the role.

### Common Variables

* The action to perform when playing the role.  Defaults to `template`.  When
  the value is `append`, `insert` or `delete`, current iptables ruleset is the
  starting point, and `iptables_apply__rules` the rules to be appended,
  inserted or deleted.  Also note that like with the **iptables** module, the
  rules that already exist in a chain are not moved within this chain. But they
  can be updated if only one of their destination port(s) or comment string has
  changed.

  The action `flush` is also supported. It removes all rules and resets policy
  to *ACCEPT* for all chains of the tables listed in the variable
  `iptables_apply__flush_tables` (*filter* by default). This action makes that
  the service is *stopped* and *disabled*.

```yaml
iptables_apply__action: template
```

* The iptables rules to `append`/`insert` to, or to `delete` from the current
  rules, depending on `iptables_apply__action` value.  This is a list of
  dictionaries accepting the following keys:

  | key | mandatory | type | choices | default | description |
  | :-- | :-------- | :--- | :------ | :------ | :---------- |
  | `chain` | no | keyword | `INPUT`, `FORWARD`, `OUTPUT` | `INPUT` | The chain the rule will be added to. |
  | `dport` | yes | string or integer ||| Port number, port range, or comma-separated list of port numbers and port ranges. |
  | `jump` | no | keyword | `ACCEPT`, `DROP`, `REJECT` | `ACCEPT` | What to do with packets matching the rule. |
  | `name` | yes | string ||| Used as the rule's comment. |
  | `protocol` | no | keyword | `tcp`, `udp` | `tcp` | The protocol packets have to match. |
  | `saddr` | no | string ||| The IP source address packets have to match. |

  Defaults to an empty list (`[]`). Example:

```yaml
iptables_apply__rules:
  - name: PostgreSQL
    dport: 5432
    saddr: 10.122.43.21
    #protocol: tcp
    #chain: INPUT
    #jump: ACCEPT
  - name: Knot DNS
    dport: 53,953
    protocol: udp
```

### Advanced Variables

* Whether or not to make the currently applied ruleset persistent across
  reboots.

```yaml
iptables_apply__persist: true
```

* The following variable defines the firewall's service name. As the
  implementation may vary a lot, only two services are currently supported:
  `iptables` for **Redhat** family, and `netfilter-persistent` for **Debian**
  family.

```yaml
iptables_apply__service: iptables
```

* This variable defines the path of the file to save firewall state into,
  to make the currently applied ruleset persistent across reboots.

```yaml
iptables_apply__service_ruleset: /etc/sysconfig/iptables
```

* The two following variables are about firewall's service management.
  Running state defaults to `true`, activation state defaults to `true`.

```yaml
iptables_apply__service_enabled: true
iptables_apply__service_started: true
```

* The following variable defines the path of a temporary file that will be
  used as buffer, starting with initial state of the firewall (table filter
  for actions `append`, `delete` or `insert`), or with templated rules (with
  actions `template` or `flush`).

```yaml
iptables_apply__path_buffer: /run/iptables.buffer
```

Template Variables
------------------

The following variables refer to the template that comes with the role.  They
make sense as long as `iptables_apply__action`'s value is `template`.

All variables used by the role are explicitly declared either in *defaults* or
in *vars* directories. Those declared in *vars* shouldn't be overridden in
almost all cases (and can't be overridden from inventory). So this section
is divided in two parts,
[Common Templating](#common-templating) and
[Advanced Templating](#advanced-templating)

### Common Templating

* This defines the path of a template file that once evaluated is used as input
  for the command `iptables-restore`.  Defaults to the template shipped with
  the role.

```yaml
iptables_apply__template: iptables_apply.j2
```

* The iptables rules to apply in addition to the sanity rules provided by the
  template.  This is a list of dictionaries with the same keys than
  `iptables_apply__rules`, and defaults to the same value.

```yaml
iptables_apply__template_rules: "{{ iptables_apply__rules }}"
```

### Advanced Templating

* If `True`, current iptables ruleset is not flushed and rules from the template
  (the one shipped with the role) are **inserted** before the current ones. This
  variable is silently ignored if the current running state of iptables already
  contains `iptables_apply__template_mark`'s value, that makes it usable as a
  one-shot-option, avoiding to duplicate rules too much (thus, without modifying
  the playbook nor its commandline call).

```yaml
iptables_apply__template_noflush: false
```

* Whether or not to apply the core ruleset provided by the template. The core
  rules, a.k.a. sanity rules, are inserted to ensure they will be evaluated
  first even if `iptables_apply__template_noflush` is true.  Defaults to `true`.

```yaml
iptables_apply__template_core: true
```

* The default policy to apply for each chain of the filter table.  If a policy
  is undefined in this variable, then it will be changed to `ACCEPT` on the
  target. For example, to blank all current policies:
  `iptables_apply__template_policy: {}`

```yaml
iptables_apply__template_policy:
  input: DROP
  forward: DROP
  output: ACCEPT
```

* As the templating of a temporary file can't be idempotent, and as the
  templating of iptables is in itself very agressive, there must be a way to
  not replay the template action to not loose application rules appended
  between two plays. This is the purpose of this variable. Set it to `false`
  to force a replay.

```yaml
iptables_apply__template_once: true
```

* This variable defines a string that should be found in the `iptables-save`
  output to know/decide if the templated ruleset is already in use. Defaults
  to the rule dropping TCP packets in state `NEW` and not coming with only the
  `SYN` flag. NOTE that there is a short writing of this rule, but the output
  is always the same:

```yaml
# short writing: '-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp ! --syn -m comment --comment "bad NEWs" -j DROP'
iptables_apply__template_mark: '-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp ! --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -m comment --comment "bad NEWs" -j DROP'
```

* This defines the path of an alternative template used to flush rules and
  reset policies to ACCEPT all packets. It is only effective when
  `iptables_apply__action` is set to `flush`.

```yaml
iptables_apply__flush: iptables_flush.j2
```

* This lists the tables to flush when evaluating `iptables_flush.j2`, i.e.
  either when
  `iptables_apply__action = flush` and
  `iptables_apply__flush = iptables_flush.j2`, or when
  `iptables_apply__template = iptables_flush.j2`.
  It accepts either a keyword (table name or `all`) or a list of these
  keywords. Defaults to `filter`.

```yaml
# choices: all, filter, nat, mangle, raw, security
iptables_apply__flush_tables: filter
```

Dependencies
------------

None.

Example Playbook
----------------

Apply the core ruleset, ensuring a secure base setup with ssh access allowed
and no more.

```yaml
---
- hosts: servers
  become: yes
  roles:
    - role: iptables_apply
```

Apply the same ruleset on an already configured firewall you want to keep.

```yaml
---
- hosts: servers
  become: yes
  roles:
    - role: iptables_apply
      iptables_apply__template_noflush: yes
```

Apply core ruleset and some passing rules for monitoring tools.

```yaml
---
- hosts: servers
  become: yes
  roles:
    - role: iptables_apply
      iptables_apply__template_rules:
        - name: NRPE
          dport: 5666
        - name: SNMP
          dport: 161
        - name: SNMP
          dport: 161
          protocol: udp
```

Add a single and simple passing rule. Replace `append` by `delete` to remove it.

```yaml
---
- hosts: dns-servers
  become: yes
  roles:
    - role: iptables_apply
      iptables_apply__action: append
      iptables_apply__rules:
        - name: Knot DNS
          dport: 53,953
          protocol: udp
```

Do almost whatever you want, and bypass the rollback feature, by calling a
tasks file that uses ansible's `iptables` module. The action of the role
(`iptables_apply__action`) doesn't matter here, unless you explicitly map
rule's `action` and `state` to it.

```yaml
---
- hosts: db-servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - include_role:
        name: iptables_apply
        tasks_from: iptables.yml
  vars:
    iptables_apply__iptables:
      - action: insert
        chain: INPUT
        protocol: tcp
        source: 10.112.43.21,10.75.43.21
        source_port: "1024:"
        destination_port: 5432
        ctstate: NEW
        syn: match
        comment: "postgresql.service"
        jump: ACCEPT
        state: present
```

Do whatever you want with a custom template. It may as well include policies
and rules for any table, not only the filter one.

```yaml
---
- hosts: routers
  become: yes
  roles:
    - role: iptables_apply
      iptables_apply__template: iptables/routers.j2
```

Manage persistence of the current ruleset:

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - include_role:
        name: iptables_apply
        tasks_from: iptables_state.yml
      vars:
        iptables_state__state: saved
        iptables_state__path: /etc/sysconfig/iptables
```

Or manage the service (for example disable it and keep it started):

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - include_role:
        name: iptables_apply
        tasks_from: iptables-service.yml
      vars:
        iptables_apply__service_enabled: false
        iptables_apply__service_started: true
```

You may also want to play this role from another one (here, say from `foobar`):

```yaml
- include_role:
    name: iptables_apply
  vars:
    iptables_apply__action: "{{ 'append' if foobar__action == 'setup' else 'delete' }}"
    iptables_apply__rules:
      - name: FooBar over HTTP/HTTPS
        dport: "{{ foobar__http_port }},{{ foobar__https_port }}"
```
